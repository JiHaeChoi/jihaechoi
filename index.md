# Ji-Whiz

## About Me

Hi! I am **Ji Hae Choi** (pronounced "Jee-Hay"). 
I am a Ph.D. student in the MORS (Management & Organizations) department at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University and researcher in residence at NICO (Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems. I am advised by Professor Brian Uzzi. 
Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, I began my academic journey studying Economics and Management Science before extending into computational social science at business school.

## Research Interests

I am fascinated by **how culture is shared and shaped in society**. My research explores how power dynamics and institutional forces shape people's *objective functions*, creating environments that realign with societal demands. Specifically, I investigate how our conceptual spaces are restructured by society, particularly through our close social networks.

- **Cultural Evolution:** How culture is transmitted and transformed through social networks and institutional power dynamics
- **Large Language Models:** Monitoring knowledge evolution and understanding cognitive structures through computational methods
- **Network Analysis:** Board networks, social influence, and organizational dynamics

### Active Projects

**LLM-Based Expertise Extraction**: Developing methods to identify and track the evolution of director expertise using large language models and advanced ML techniques.

**Neural Activity and LLM Correlations**: Investigating the relationship between neural patterns and language model representations to better understand cognitive processes.

**Knowledge Structuralization**: Using LLMs to reorganize human knowledge according to recurring patterns in our thought structures, creating more quantifable knowledge frameworks.
